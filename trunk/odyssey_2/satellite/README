This code is the result of my ongoing experimentation with lowlevel programming for the Magnavox Odyssey² (a.k.a. VIDEOPAC G7000) video game.
It is written in 8048 assembly language. You can learn more about it here: http://soeren.informationstheater.de/g7000/

You can build it my running "make rom"
By running "make" it will create a ROM file and load it into the o2em emulator

== Dependancies ==
* asl (8048 assembler): http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/download.html
* python interpreter
* perl interpreter to run the script that converts PNM images into include files

== optional tools ==
* you can use GIMP to edit the sprite shapes (PNM file)

== Emulator ==
You will need an Odyssey² emulator to run the compiled code.

Obviously you can also write the ROM file to a real cartridge and use your old Odyssey² console, but that's certainly harder.

== Licensing ==
This code is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or later.
